The complete MSP430 instruction set consists of 27 core instructions. There are an additional 24 emulated instructions which are translated to core instructions by the assembler software. When compared to the command set of some higher level languages, these machine instructions are very basic, performing tasks such as mathematical and logical operations, writing and retrieving values from memory, and branching to different sections of code.
